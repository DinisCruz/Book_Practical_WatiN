## Trigger an Keypress event in IE

Using O2's IE Automation (which is a wrapper on top of [WatiN](http://watin.org/)), if you need to trigger an Javascript event, there are a couple ways this can be done:

  * **directly entering the value on the field** -  try something like: _ie.field("fieldName").value("aaa");_    depending on how the original Javascript event hook is set-up that might just do the trick
  * **directly invoking the javascript function that handles the KeyPress - **O2 has now quite extended support for Javascript, and you can easily perform javascript invokes (and receive callbacks). See this links for more details

There are already good support for jQuery in O2 which you can leverage:

  * [O2 jQuery API](http://code.google.com/p/o2platform/source/browse/trunk/O2_Scripts/#O2_Scripts%2FAPIs%2F_Javascript_Libraries%2FJQuery)
  * [Util - Simple jQuery script GUI.h2](http://code.google.com/p/o2platform/source/browse/trunk/O2_Scripts/APIs/_Javascript_Libraries/JQuery/Util%20-%20Simple%20jQuery%20script%20GUI.h2)
  * [Util - XSS PoC Tester - Viewer.h2](http://code.google.com/p/o2platform/source/browse/trunk/O2_Scripts/_Sample_Vulnerabilities/Util%20-%20XSS%20PoC%20Tester%20-%20Viewer.h2)

* **use Windows UIAutomation** - at last resort you can move the mouse to the location of the field (javascript/WatiN can help to find the screen position) , then simulate a mouse click and finally enter some text (this is basically using Windows to simulate your actions). See this script for an example on how to the use [White](http://white.codeplex.com/) API (which is the equivalent of WatiN by from Windows): [PoC - Automating Notepad.h2](http://code.google.com/p/o2platform/source/browse/trunk/O2_Scripts/APIs/Windows/White/PoC%20-%20Automating%20Notepad.h2)
